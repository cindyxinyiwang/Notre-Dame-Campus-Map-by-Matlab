Notre-Dame-Campus-Map-by-Matlab
===============================
This is a working map GUI for Notre Dame campus. It displays the campus map with almost all the main buildings pinpointed. 
User could either select building point directly on the map or use the drop down menu. It also supports indoor/outdoor 
routes. Optimal route is recommended based on the weather condition indicated by a slider.
